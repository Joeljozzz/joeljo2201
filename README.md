.........................................................................................................................................................................
I'm a Data Science enthusiast with a passion for Python, Excel, KNIME, Google Data Studio, PowerBI, machine learning, and SQL. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from SIES College of Arts Science and Commerce (Mumbai University Affiliated), and I'm currently enrolled in the Data Analytics for Business Decision Making course at Durham College in Canada.

Aside from my studies, I love exploring new technologies and building cool projects. I've developed Discord bots, web applications for general purposes, and even worked on a final year project called Pulse Infographics during my Bachelors. I'm also well-versed in backend development.

Before moving to Canada, I've completed two internships, one at ERP Launchpad and the other at Mettler Toledo GBSI. These internships have allowed me to gain hands-on experience in the industry, and I'm excited to continue learning and growing in my field.

I'm always looking for new opportunities and challenges, so feel free to connect with me! Let's collaborate and make something amazing.
